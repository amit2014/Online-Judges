DFS

1. grafixMask -- DFS Problem implemented using stack of struct -- objective was to find the consecutive blocks.(400*600)
2. Marketing -- DFS Problem implemented using Recursion -- objective was to find bi-parite graph.(50*50)
3. Circuits -- DSF Problem implemnted using stack of struct -- objective was to find the longest path in a graph.(50*50)


BFS

<SMALL ERROR> 1. PathFinding -- BFS Problem implemented using QUEUE -- objective was to swap 2 ppl @ diff places (20*20)
<TOUGH><ERROR> 2. Escape -- BFS Problem implemented using queue -- -- to reach a places with minimum life loss -- contition arises at places (500*500)

DIJKSTRA

<TOUGH> <CAN ALSO BE IMPLEMENTED BY DP> 1. KiloManX -- implemented using priority_queue and operator overloading of '<' -- good use of binary representation 
						    -- shortest path to a situation always leads to the shortest path to the next level.
<NOT DONE> <TOUGH> 2. RoboCourier -- to be implemented using priority_queue -- pivot about a point and moves in hexagonal direction.
3. BombMan -- implemented using priority_queue -- eassy question with a very small trick of the bomb condition
4. Thirteen -- -do- -- easy question..
